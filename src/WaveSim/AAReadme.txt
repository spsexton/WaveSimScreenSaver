WaveSim Screen Saver
Sean Sexton 28 Aug 2008


- To install screen saver:
  - Build solution
  - Rename WaveSimScrSaver.exe to WaveSimScrSaver.scr
  - Hand-copy WaveSimScrSaver.scr to C:\Windows\system32
    (not sure why, but if you use context menu to install, it doesn't get copied to system32 and doesnt "stick")
